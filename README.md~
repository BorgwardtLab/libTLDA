# da-tools
Matlab toolbox for domain adaptation algorithms. More methods (and better documentation) will be added soon.

Dependencies: <br>
- MinFunc (https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/Software/minFunc.html)

Usage: <br>
- Supply labeled source data (XQ,yQ) and target data (XP) and the methods output a trained classifier or a label prediction for XP. <br>

Contains:<br>
- irw: Instance Reweighting (includes importance weight estimation methods such as Kernel Mean Matching from Huang et al., 2006) <br>
- scl: Structural Correspondence Learning (Blitzer et al., 2006) <br>
- gfk: Geodesic Flow Kernel (Gong et al., 2012) <br>
- tca: Transfer Component Analysis (Pan et al, 2009) <br>
- sa: Subspace Alignment (Fernando et al., 2013) <br>
- flda: Feature-Level Domain Adaptation (in press) <br>
